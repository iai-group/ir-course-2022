The collected dataset consists of: \n","\n","\n","1.   **User Request**: an initial user request in the conversational form, e.g., \"What is Fickle Creek Farm?\", with a label reflects if clarification is needed ranged from 1 to 4;\n","2.   **Clarification questions**: a set of possible clarifying questions, e.g., \"Do you want to know the location of fickle creek farm?\";\n","3.   **User Answers**: each questions is supplied with a user answer, e.g., \"No, I want to find out where can i purchase fickle creek farm products.\"\n","\n","\n","For training, the collected dataset is split into training (187 topics) and validation (50 topics) sets. For testing, the participants are supplied with: (1) a set of user requests in conversational form and (2) a set of questions (i.e., question bank) which contains all the questions that we have collected for the collection. Therefore there are the following two tasks:\n","\n","1.   Given a user request, return a score [1−4] indicating the necessity of asking clarifying questions.\n","2.   Given a user request which needs clarification, return the most suitable clarifying question. Here participants are able to choose: \n","      * either select the clarifying question from the provided question bank (all clarifying questions we collected), aiming to maximize the precision, \n","      * or choose not to ask any question (by choosing Q0001 from the question bank.)\n","\n","In this notebook we investigate the BM25 ranker being a simple baseline model. It ranks the questions simply by their BM25 relevance score compared to the original_request."],"metadata":{"id":"SfyNgSN-tJCL"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_7_2LTXoXqK7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667219834140,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":15362,"user":{"displayName":"Weronika
