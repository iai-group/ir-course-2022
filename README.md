# DAT640-2022: Information Retrieval and Text Mining course, University of Stavanger

This repository contains course material (lectures, labs, and assignments) for the 2022 fall edition of the course.

## Course format

The course followed a standard format, with lectures, assignments and group projects. Physical lecturing led by the lecturer, included discussions, Kahoot quizzes, and hands-on exercises. The lectures were not be recorded/streamed, physical attendance was expected. Individual assignments  led by the TAs were dedicated time to work on graded assignments. Student that needed help with assignments were expected to attend in person. Group projects meetings were 15 minutes time slots dedicated for getting help/feedback on progress and ideas.

The semester (consisting of 13 weeks) was divided into two periods: (1) lectures [lectures](lectures/) and individual assignments during the first 10 weeks, with group projects [group project work](projects/) running in parallel, (2) last 3 weeks dedicated entirely to the group projects. Dedicated time was provided to get help with the individual assignments (from TAs) as well as to get feedback on the group project (from lecturer and TAs).

### Grading

The overall grade came from two components, both of which needed to be >F in order to pass:

  * 40% Project work. Half of the score came from the [individual assignments](assignments/) and another half from the [group project](project/).
  * 60% Written (digital) exam.

## Assignments

During the course, students needed to complete 9 assignments (deliverables) individually. These were graded and accounted for 50% of the project work (i.e., 20% of the final grade). Students were given a certain time limit (typically 10 days) to complete each assignment. For each assignment students were provided with the Python file with code skeleton which they were expected to complete according to the task description. Assignments were graded automatically, using a combination of public and hidden tests. Public tests were released together with the assignment; if the solution passed these tests, it was likely correct. However, in addition to those tests, there were some hidden tests that the solution was be tested against after submission; these typically contained larger inputs/datasets, corner cases, or other inputs in order to test that the student fully understood the methods and/or followed the instructions.
